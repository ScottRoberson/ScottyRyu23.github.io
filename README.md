I attempted to mock up the wrigley field tours site on MLB.com the original link is https://www.mlb.com/cubs/ballpark/tours
This is obviously is not my original wirting but the main objective was to try and replicate the look and layout to the best of my abilites.
I changed the landing at the top because I started a different project and decided to try and replicate this to practice my HTML & CSS.
