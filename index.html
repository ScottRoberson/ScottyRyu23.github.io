 <div class="tour-info">
 	<p>"I think every baseball fan must go see Wrigley. The stories I learned while on the tour, I've been telling friends and family since I came back."</p>
 	<p>"The BEST all-around baseball game experience I have EVER hadâ€¦ and I am a Dodger fan by the way!"</p>
 	<p>"To walk on the grounds & sit in the dugout where Ron Santo & Ernie Banks sat... surreal!!"</p>
 	<p>"It gave the iconic ballpark even more depth than just attending a game."</p>


 	<p>"It's such an iconic place, synonymous with Chicago, a visit to the city would be incomplete, without a visit to Wrigley Field."</p>


 	<p>"(Our tour guide) was a wonderful guide. He was friendly, funny and very knowledgeable. I thought going into the dugout and being on the field was very special. I thought that the visitors' locker room was fun despite its humble appearance based on the historical significance of everyone who had been there. Really great tour. I have told everybody about it."</p>
